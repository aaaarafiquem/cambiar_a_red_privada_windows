This script it's to switch public network to private on Windows.
Especially when we are working with virtual machines it's a nuisance to have to do it all the time 
so I did a simple script that helps you to change it. If you execute it, it will run the command **Get-NetConnectionProfile**
and then you can select the Index of the ethernet card you wish to change. Then it will automatically switchs!
